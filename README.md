# Coding Task Name: Sentiment Analysis and Text Similarity with spaCy

## Description
This project demonstrates sentiment analysis and text similarity calculations using the spaCy NLP library and SpacyTextBlob pipeline. The script processes Amazon product reviews, performs sentiment analysis, and calculates similarity scores between reviews. Learning these skills is crucial for understanding how to work with Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to extract insights from text data.
